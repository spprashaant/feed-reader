# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. This application uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for unit testing.


## How to run the application

Save all the project files and folders in the server environment in the same structure as the original source content. Open the index.html in a web browser. 

All the feeds should be displayed for the default feed. All the unit test results should be displayed at the bottom of the page. 

If any changes are done to the code, the existing unit tests should pass if there is no change to the existing behaviour. Also, new test suites and test cases needs to be added for the new code.



## Usage

When the page is refreshed, the default feed is displayed. If the feed needs to be changed, click on the menu icon on the top left of the page and select another feed. The corresponding feed should get displayed on the page.
